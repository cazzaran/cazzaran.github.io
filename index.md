## FlowerStory

Born in the heart of a Colombian girl who made flower crowns after hours of traversing her parent’s coffee plantations as a child, Florango Truck serves the greater Los Angeles area with environmentally responsible flower bouquets, arrangements and flower crowns to say anything to someone you have a message for. Florango Truck has a floral delivery idea for any message, whether intended for your loved one, co-worker, boss, future client, first or last date, or even for your favorite pet. The first carbon neutral flower truck in the US, Florango Truck is committed to promoting green business and floral practices, engaging every team member through its Employee Pledge to the environment as members of Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project.

## Messengers

Flowers don’t only say; I love you. They can say anything, such as: Thanks, I didn’t think you’d do it! Hey, you’re smarter than I thought. You ARE human’s best friend. Might as well celebrate losing! I’ve gotta believe you’ve got this. There’s no escape, we’re in this together. Nope, I wasn’t great. You make me smile, but this news won’t. Or even; You stunk, but I’m over it. There is power in the flower and Florango Truck can help you share your sentiments perfectly.
